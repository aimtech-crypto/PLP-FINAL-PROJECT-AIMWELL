# 🌱 TerraRegen — AI-Powered Land Regeneration & Crop Yield Prediction  
*[Live Demo → https://terraregen.vercel.app/]*  

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

**TerraRegen** is an AI-driven platform that focuses on **land regeneration and crop yield prediction**. Through intelligent data processing, machine learning, and environmental modeling, the project aims to help farmers, agronomists, and communities to:

- Predict crop yields based on soil, climate, and land conditions  
- Suggest regenerative practices that restore soil health  
- Support sustainable farming aligned with **SDG 2: Zero Hunger**  

By combining yield prediction with land rehabilitation insights, TerraRegen not only forecasts production but also encourages practices that ensure long-term fertility and ecosystem resilience.

---

## 🔗 Live Demo

Access the live version here:  
[https://terraregen.vercel.app/](https://terraregen.vercel.app/)

You can explore the UI and test predictions directly from your browser.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

| Layer | Technology / Tool |
|------|---------------------|
| Backend | Node.js |
| AI / ML | (TensorFlow.js / or Python microservices — your architecture) |
| Frontend | Web UI (React / browser framework) |
| Database | (e.g. MongoDB / Firebase / other persistent store) |
| APIs / Data Sources | Weather, soil / land data, satellite / remote sensing, etc. |
| Hosting / Deployment | Vercel |

The platform fetches environmental and land data, processes it with AI models, and displays predictions & insights through an intuitive web interface.

---

## 🎯 Key Features & Capabilities

- **Predictive Modeling** — Generate crop yield forecasts based on inputs and local data  
- **Land Regeneration Suggestions** — Recommend regenerative practices (cover cropping, mulching, etc.)  
- **Interactive Dashboard** — Visualize results, compare scenarios, and explore trends  
- **Data-Driven Insights** — Show relationships between soil health, weather, and yield  
- **Sustainability Alignment** — Emphasis on ecological restoration along with productivity  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start / Usage

1. Open the live app: [terraregen.vercel.app](https://terraregen.vercel.app/)  
2. Input (or select) relevant data: soil parameters, crop type, region, etc.  
3. Click **“Predict”** or equivalent action button  
4. View predictions, charts, and recommendations for land regeneration  
5. Optionally download or export results, if available  

> **Note:** The current deployment suggests a browser-based, for local instalation just click install in your browser

## 📈 Impact & Vision

TerraRegen aims to:

- **Boost food security** by improving prediction accuracy and farming decisions  
- **Empower smallholder farmers** with accessible AI tools  
- **Regenerate degraded lands** through informed ecological practices  
- **Align with SDG 2: Zero Hunger** by improving yields sustainably  

Over time, the platform can evolve into a tool for agricultural planning at regional and national scales, aiding policymakers and researchers.

---

## 🛣 Roadmap & Future Directions

- Expand **regional and crop-specific model variations** for localized accuracy  
- Integrate **satellite / remote sensing data** to enrich predictions  
- Add **mobile / offline mode** for field conditions with low connectivity  
- Introduce **guided workflows / chatbot advisor** to support decision making  
- Build **community dashboards / benchmarking tools** for comparison and sharing
